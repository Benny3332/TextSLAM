# TextSLAM (coming soon)

:star: TextSLAM is a novel visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping system (SLAM) tightly coupled with semantic text objects.

:bulb: Humans can read texts and navigate complex environments using scene texts, such as road markings and room names. why not robots?

:star: TextSLAM explores scene texts as the basic feature both geometrically and semantically. It achieves superior performance even under challenging environments, such as image blurring, large viewpoint changes, and significant illumination variations (day and night).

In the project we provide:
- **C++ implementation of our TextSLAM system**  
- **A large text-orientated dataset covering indoor and outdoor scenes with ground truth.**
